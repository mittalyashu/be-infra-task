# Be-Infra-Task

## Notes/thoughts/comments

* I've used mono-repo architect
* Had to explicitly install `source-map-support` package as devDependency due to some issue related to how PNPM resolves the dependencies.
* It seems the `user` and `orders` service have same endpoint routes
* I have created named-Dockerfile for respective services in-case the service use-case expands.
* Each Dockerfile is configured for local development and is not production-ready.
